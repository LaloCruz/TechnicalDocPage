                <header>What is Arduino?</header>
                <p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. <span>Arduino
                        boards</span> are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter
                    message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something
                    online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller
                    on the board. To do so you use the <span>Arduino programming language</span> (based on Wiring), and
                    the <span>Arduino Software (IDE)</span>, based on <span>Processing</span>. </p>

                <p>
                    Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to
                    complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists,
                    programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions
                    have added up to an incredible amount of <span>accessible knowledge</span> that can be of great
                    help to novices and experts alike.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping,
                    aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a
                    wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges,
                    differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D
                    printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering
                    users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. <span>The
                        software</span>, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users
                    worldwide.

                <header>Why Arduino?</header>
                <p>Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different
                    projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough
                    for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Teachers and students use it to build low
                    cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started with
                    programming and robotics. Designers and architects build interactive prototypes, musicians and
                    artists use it for installations and to experiment with new musical instruments. Makers, of course,
                    use it to build many of the projects exhibited at the Maker Faire, for example. Arduino is a key
                    tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering
                    just following the step by step instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other members
                    of the Arduino community</p>

                <p>There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical
                    computing. Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others
                    offer similar functionality. All of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller
                    programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package. Arduino also simplifies the process of
                    working with microcontrollers, but it offers some advantage for teachers, students, and interested
                    amateurs over other systems:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span>Inexpensive</span> - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other
                        microcontroller platforms. The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled
                        by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less than $50
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Cross-platform</span> - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and
                        Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows.</li>
                    <li><span>Simple, clear programming environment</span> - The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use
                        for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. For
                        teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students
                        learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE work</li>
                    <li><span>Open source and extensible software</span> - The Arduino software is published as open
                        source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The language can be expanded
                        through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap
                        from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based. Similarly, you can add
                        AVR-C code directly into your Arduino programs if you want to.</li>
                    <li><span>Open source and extensible hardware</span> - The plans of the Arduino boards are
                        published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit designers can make their own
                        version of the module, extending it and improving it. Even relatively inexperienced users can
                        build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and save money.</li>

                <p>
                    Arduino/Genuino boards senses the environment by receiving inputs from many sensors, and affects
                    their surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other actuators. Arduino/Genuino boards are
                    the microcontroller development platform that will be at the heart of your projects. When making
                    something you will be building the circuits and interfaces for interaction, and telling the
                    microcontroller how to interface with other components. Here the anatomy of Arduino/Genuino Uno.

                <p>
                    The Arduino Integrated Development Environment - or Arduino Software (IDE) - contains a text editor
                    for writing code, a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a
                    series of menus. It connects to the Arduino and Genuino hardware to upload programs and communicate
                    with them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Programs written using Arduino Software (IDE) are called sketches. These sketches are written in
                    the text editor and are saved with the file extension .ino. The editor has features for
                    cutting/pasting and for searching/replacing text. The message area gives feedback while saving and
                    exporting and also displays errors. The console displays text output by the Arduino Software (IDE),
                    including complete error messages and other information. The bottom righthand corner of the window
                    displays the configured board and serial port. The toolbar buttons allow you to verify and upload
                    programs, create, open, and save sketches, and open the serial monitor.

            <section id="Variables" class="contenedor main-section">
                <header>Variables</header>
                <p>A variable is a place to store a piece of data. It has a name, a value, and a type. For example,
                    this statement (called a declaration):</p>

                <p><code>
                int pin = 13;
                </code></p>

                <p>creates a variable whose name is <span>pin</span>, whose value is <span>13</span>, and whose type is
                    int. Later on in the program, you can refer to this variable by its name, at which point its value
                    will be looked up and used. For example, in this statement:</p>
                
                <p>
                    <code>
                            pinMode(pin, OUTPUT);
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                        it is the value of pin (13) that will be passed to the pinMode() function. In this case, you don't actually need to use a variable, this statement would work just as well:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                            pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                        The advantage of a variable in this case is that you only need to specify the actual number of the pin once, but you can use it lots of times. So if you later decide to change from pin 13 to pin 12, you only need to change one spot in the code. Also, you can use a descriptive name to make the significance of the variable clear (e.g. a program controlling an RGB LED might have variables called redPin, greenPin, and bluePin).
                </p>
                <p>
                        A variable has other advantages over a value like a number. Most importantly, you can change the value of a variable using an assignment (indicated by an equals sign). For example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                            pin = 12;
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>
                        will change the value of the variable to 12. Notice that we don't specify the type of the variable: it's not changed by the assignment. That is, the name of the variable is permanently associated with a type; only its value changes. [1] Note that you have to declare a variable before you can assign a value to it. If you include the preceding statement in a program without the first statement above, you'll get a message like: "error: pin was not declared in this scope".

                        When you assign one variable to another, you're making a copy of its value and storing that copy in the location in memory associated with the other variable. Changing one has no effect on the other. For example, after:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <code>
                            int pin = 13;
                            int pin2 = pin;
                            pin = 12; 
                    </code>
                </p>

                <p>
                        only pin has the value 12; pin2 is still 13.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="Functions" class="contenedor main-section">
                <header>Functions</header>
                <p>
                    Segmenting code into functions allows a programmer to create modular pieces of code that perform a defined task and then return to the area of code from which the function was "called". The typical case for creating a function is when one needs to perform the same action multiple times in a program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For programmers accustomed to using BASIC, functions in Arduino provide (and extend) the utility of using subroutines (GOSUB in BASIC).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Standardizing code fragments into functions has several advantages:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Functions help the programmer stay organized. Often this helps to conceptualize the program.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions codify one action in one place so that the function only has to be thought out and debugged once.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This also reduces chances for errors in modification, if the code needs to be changed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Functions make the whole sketch smaller and more compact because sections of code are reused many times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        They make it easier to reuse code in other programs by making it more modular, and as a nice side effect, using functions also often makes the code more readable.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    There are two required functions in an Arduino sketch, setup() and loop(). Other functions must be created outside the brackets of those two functions. As an example, we will create a simple function to multiply two numbers.
                </p>

                <img src="https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Reference/FuncAnatomy.png" alt="c function">

                <p>
                    To "call" our simple multiply function, we pass it parameters of the datatype that it is expecting:
                </p>

                <p>

                <p>
                    Our function needs to be declared outside any other function, so "myMultiplyFunction()" can go either above or below the "loop()" function.

                    Libraries are a collection of code that makes it easy for you to connect to a sensor, display, module, etc. For example, the built-in LiquidCrystal library makes it easy to talk to character LCD displays. There are hundreds of additional libraries available on the Internet for download. The built-in libraries and some of these additional libraries are listed in the reference. To use the additional libraries, you will need to install them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To install a new library into your Arduino IDE you can use the Library Manager (available from IDE version 1.6.2). Open the IDE and click to the "Sketch" menu and then Include Library > Manage Libraries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then the Library Manager will open and you will find a list of libraries that are already installed or ready for installation. In this example we will install the Bridge library. Scroll the list to find it, click on it, then select the version of the library you want to install. Sometimes only one version of the library is available. If the version selection menu does not appear, don't worry: it is normal.
                </p>

                <img src="https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Guide/LibraryManager_2.png" alt="search library">

                <p>
                    Finally click on install and wait for the IDE to install the new library. Downloading may take time depending on your connection speed. Once it has finished, an Installed tag should appear next to the Bridge library. You can close the library manager.

                <img src="https://www.arduino.cc/en/uploads/Guide/LibraryManager_3.png" alt="install library">

                <p>
                    You can now find the new library available in the Sketch > Include Library menu.
